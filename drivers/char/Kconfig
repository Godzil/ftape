	  If you have a tape drive that is connected to your floppy
	  controller, say Y here.

	  Some tape drives (like the Seagate "Tape Store 3200" or the Iomega
	  "Ditto 3200" or the Exabyte "Eagle TR-3") come with a "high speed"
	  controller of their own. These drives (and their companion
	  controllers) are also supported if you say Y here.

	  If you have a special controller (such as the CMS FC-10, FC-20,
	  Mountain Mach-II, or any controller that is based on the Intel 82078
	  FDC like the high speed controllers by Seagate and Exabyte and
	  Iomega's "Ditto Dash") you must configure it by selecting the
	  appropriate entries from the "Floppy tape controllers" sub-menu
	  below and possibly modify the default values for the IRQ and DMA
	  channel and the IO base in ftape's configuration menu.

	  If you want to use your floppy tape drive on a PCI-bus based system,
	  please read the file <file:drivers/char/ftape/README.PCI>.

	  The ftape kernel driver is also available as a runtime loadable
	  module. To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ftape.
